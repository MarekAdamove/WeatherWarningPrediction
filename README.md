# Weather Warning Prediction

In this project we predict *warning* indicator of the measured weather situations at various places.

Project is split into three notebooks:

- *Exploratory Data Analysis*
    - Contains exploratory data analysis of the dataset and basic hypothesis testing that could further help preprocess the data and fully utilize them.

- *Data Preproessing*
    - Cleaning a preparing data for machine learning algorithms.

- *Modelling*
    - Predicting weather indicator using oneR algorithm, Decision Trees and Random Forests. We also do hyperparameter tuning.
